        description: "South of Puerto Vallarta, but still within the state of Jalisco, running from the southern tip of Banderas Bay (Cabo Corrientes) southeasterly to Barra de Navidad (and to Jalisco’s border with the state of Colima), lies a spectacular coastline that, for the most part, has avoided major development. It consists of just a few small beachside towns scattered along its coastline, interspersed by a number of very high-end, quite private, luxury resorts.",

It is quite mountainous, covered for the most part with lush tropical forest along a rugged coastline, interspersed with small white-sand beaches, creating a stark contrast to the almost desert-like geography at Punta Mita on the opposite side of the bay. Within the bay, Cabo Corrientes’ shoreline features a few small fishing villages or beach destinations such as Yelapa, Las Ánimas, Quimixto, and Chimo.",
